# Operators

1. **Increment / Decrement (`++`, `--`)**
    - Increment increases the value of a variable by 1.
    - Decrement decreases the value of a variable by 1.

2. **Arithmetic Operators (`+`, `-`, `/`, `*`)**
    - Addition (`+`): Adds two values.
    - Subtraction (`-`): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand.
    - Division (`/`): Divides the left operand by the right operand.
    - Multiplication (`*`): Multiplies two values.

3. **Concatenation (`+`)**
    - Concatenation (`+`): Combines two strings in Java.

4. **Relational Operators**
    - `<` (less than)
    - `>` (greater than)
    - `<=` (less than or equal to)
    - `>=` (greater than or equal to)

5. **Equality Operators**
    - `==` (equal to)
    - `!=` (not equal to)

6. **Bitwise Operators**
    - `&` (bitwise AND)
    - `|` (bitwise OR)
    - `^` (bitwise XOR)
    - `~` (bitwise NOT)
    - `<<` (left shift)
    - `>>` (right shift)
    - `>>>` (unsigned right shift)

7. **Short-circuit Operators**
    - `&&` (logical AND): Evaluates the right operand only if the left operand is true.
    - `||` (logical OR): Evaluates the right operand only if the left operand is false.

8. **`instanceof` Operator**
    - Used to test whether an object is an instance of a particular class or interface.

9. **Assignment Operator (`=`)**
    - Assigns a value to a variable.

10. **Conditional Operator (ternary)**
    - `? :` (conditional): Evaluates a boolean expression and returns one of two values based on the result.

11. **Null Operator**
    - `??` (nullish coalescing): Returns the right-hand operand when the left-hand operand is `null`.

12. **Array Access Operator (`[]`):**
    - Used to access elements of an array.

13. **Operator Precedence**
    - Determines the order in which operators are evaluated.

14. **Evaluation Order of Java Operands**
    - Specifies the order in which operands are evaluated in an expression.

Note: Operator precedence and operand evaluation order are crucial for understanding how expressions are processed in Java. Always use parentheses to clarify and control the order of evaluation when needed.
