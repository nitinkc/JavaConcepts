As a general rule, you shouldn't expect to be creating your own 
interfaces, just to work with lambdas. T

The vast majority of likely operations, whether they have zero, one, or two arguments, including 
things dealing with primitive return types, or primitive arguments, have probably been built for
you. 

And you should use the features of the java.util.function package when you need to create
lambdas.
