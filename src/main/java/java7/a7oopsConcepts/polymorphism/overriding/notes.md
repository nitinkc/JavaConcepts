Overriding => same signature, child and parent but different implementation

private and final cannot be overridden

static methods cannot be overridden BUT no contribution in Polymorphism
(no dynamic binding)

also static method in subclass is hidden (if extended) by static method of parent class

Cannot reduce visibility

Covariant return type

After java 5 return type may vary i.e possible to override method by changing return type
