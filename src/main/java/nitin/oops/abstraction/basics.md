# Abstract Class

* Can't be instantiated
* public because need to be given out
* still define its constructors => invoked in constructors of subclass.
* 0 to 100% abstraction
* java.lang.Number class

You Program for Interfaces rather than implementation

Abstraction is applied in the process of identifying s/w artifacts to model the problem domain

The Chef analogy : customer -> Head chef -> {indian, chinese, Italian, Mexican} ->> multiple chefs

anyone can leave from the junior chefs and new can come. Customers need not be worried

REAL AIM : FLEXIBILITY (code can be changed but the abstraction remains the same) and not hiding

Segregation of code, free to change without affecting the business

Constructor chaining <=> for inheritance

IT IS POLYMORPHISM WHICH LINKS ABSTRACT CODE TO CONCRETE IMPLEMENTATION.
