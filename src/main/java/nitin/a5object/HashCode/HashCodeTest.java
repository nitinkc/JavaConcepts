 * <p>
 * 1. Within a same program, the result of hashCode must not change. DO NOT INCLUDE VARIABLES THAT CHANGE during
 * program execution (for example currentTimestamp for hashCode to calculate hashcode)
 * <p>
 * 2. If equals on two a5object return true, their hashCode must be Same. => to be two objects to be equal,
 * their hasCode must match. Like 2 String with same text refer to the same memory location
 * <p>
 * 3. if equals returns false, hashCode need not be different. Hashcode results do not need to be unique when called on
 * unequal objects
