## Responsive :

There should be an upper limit of response time off an application and an application should respond back to the user
within a defined time limit. Eg. For a compute intensive task

* Can design a parallel algorithm (consumes lot of resources)
* Can design async tasks ()

## Resilient

In resilient systems, deal with errors gracefully.

Eg. on DB Failures,

* Use Cache
* Use Backup db in replication sync

## Elastic

## Message Driven

Systems can achieve loose coupling. The components of the system should talk to each

other by asynchronous communication.
